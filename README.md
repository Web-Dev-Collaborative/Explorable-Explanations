# Explorable Explanations #

**Hello Parents!** Here you will find a growing collection of javascript apps I have built or built-upon to help explain concepts and tutor my two boys in math, literacy, and other subjects.

## Some Programming Principles ##

* I try to keep them mobile-friendly as young children can interact with touch-screens easier than with a mouse and keyboard.

* I put all of the main javascript, css, and html into the index.html file so that new and younger programmers can see everything in one place.

* With a few exceptions, all of these are capable of loading into a browser from the local drive. This way new and budding hackers don't need to mess with setting up web servers or needing an internet connection to run them and can develop in a text editor.
